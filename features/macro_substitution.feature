Feature: macro substitution

  In order to be able to invoke a macro we have to provide a syntax
  that can be recognized in standard fortran files and it should be
  simple and fortran-like so that it apeals to users.
  A user should be able to:
   - define a macro and give it a name
   - define the replacement body
   - type macro syntax mixed with standard fortran
   - have the preprocessor expand the body

  Scenario Outline: function call syntax with no arguments
    Given a macro "<name>" is defined as "<body>"
    When I preprocess "<input>"
    Then it should expand into "<result>"

    Examples: simple replacement
      | name | body        | input    | result      |
      | name | replacement | name()   | replacement |
      | name | replacement | log()    | log()       |
      | name | replacement | ! name() | ! name()    |
